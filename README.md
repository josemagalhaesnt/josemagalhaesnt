## :crown: About Me 
My passion for the area started as a kid inspired by watching my uncle (who is a IT support professional since I know him) working daily using his computer, doing some amazing things and then, when I finally grew up, I started to take some steps into the Web Development. My journey started in 2017 when I was engaged into a development scholarship and had the opportunity to develop my first official project as Front-End and since then I've been working hard and challenging myself to keep going to the next level.
