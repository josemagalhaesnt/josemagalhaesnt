## :crown: About Me 
My passion for the area started growing as a kid (inspired by my uncle who is a IT support professional since then) and since 2014 I started to take some steps into the Web Development. In 2018 I was engaged into a scholarship and started to develop my first official project as Front-End and since then I've been working hard to keep going to the next level.
